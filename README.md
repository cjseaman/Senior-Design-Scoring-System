## Introduction

This manual provides instructions that detail how a user is designed to use the Senior Design Scoring System web application. 

## The User Account

Authorized users are those added to the system by the application administrator. If authorized, you will receive an email containing necessary information to log in to the system. 

## The Login Page

Using your email and the provided password you can log in to the application, taking you to the home page.

## Navigating the Home Page

The judge home page acts as your dashboard to access all elements of the user application. From this view you can view the projects you are assigned to under the “Project Name” tab. If you are assigned to judge a project, clicking the blue button with the correct project name will prompt a scoring form to appear, which you can fill out and submit. This section will be empty if you are not assigned to any projects.

Below the list of projects you can access the “Senior Design Experience Form” to fill out and submit. 

At any time you can return to the home page by clicking “HOME” button or logout of the application by clicking the red “LOG OUT” button at the top of the page.
