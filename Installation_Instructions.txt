Step 0:
	Make sure you have python, pip, and git installed on your computer.

	Please reference https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download and install Python.
	Reference https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ to download and install pip.
	Reference https://git-scm.com/ to download and install git.


Step 1: Install Django

	Use the command: 
	> pip install Django


Step 2: Verify Django installation

	Enter Python shell:
	> python

	From Python shell type:
	> import django
	> django.get_version()

	Exit python shell:
	> exit()


Step 3: Get project files from github

	cd to the directory where you would like the project installed and type:
	> git clone https://github.com/cjseaman/Senior-Design-Scoring-System.git


Step 4: Initialize database
	
	Inside the cloned directory:
	> cd Django/senior-design-scoring-system/

	Then run the following command to initialize your database:
	> python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb

Step 5: Start local server

	> python manage.py runserver

	This should print the following:

		Performing system checks...

		System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
		((Date and time))
		Django version ((your version)), using settings 'scoringsystem.settings'
		Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
		Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.


ADMIN LOGIN INFORMATION:

	Email: scusdscoringsystem@scu.edu
	PW:	Rr3nOqgDRk

	To create a new admin user, you must:
	1. Add the user as a judge to any created session using the master admin account above
	2. Open scoringsystem.db using a sqlite viewer of your choice (we used DB Browser for SQLite https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)
	3. Manually change the judge's value of is_admin to 1
	4. Set the value of session_id to 0 (this prevents the admin from being deleted when the session is deleted)

Because we assume you are installing this on a user system, and will only be using it short-term, you can make the website 
available online using any port forwarding software (we used ngrok). You will need to add the URL where the site is hosted 
to the ALLOWED_HOSTS section in settings.py.

(Very simple) hosting using ngrok:

	1. Install ngrok from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started

	2. Make sure your local instance is running, if not use the command:
		> python manage.py runserver

	3. Run ngrok on port 8000:
		> ngrok 8000

	4. Add the url to ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py

	5. Use the url to access an instance of the website
